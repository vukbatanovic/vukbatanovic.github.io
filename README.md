# About me
I am currently a PhD candidate at the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade, Serbia.
I study natural language processing or, more specifically, computational models of semantic similarity and sentiment analysis.
One of my main fields of interest is dealing with the particularities of short-text processing.
In addition, I am focused on creating solutions which are easily applicable not only to English, but to other, less prominent languages as well.

## Research projects
* 2017 - Researcher on the bilateral Serbian-Slovenian research project *Open Information Extraction for the Slovenian and the Serbian Language*.
* 2016-2017 - Research collaborator on the *[ReLDI (Regional Linguistic Data Initiative)](http://reldi.spur.uzh.ch/)* SNSF SCOPES project 160501 -  a two-year institutional partnership between research units in Switzerland, Serbia and Croatia. I participated in the creation, distribution and analysis of linguistic/NLP datasets and tools for Serbian and Croatian.
